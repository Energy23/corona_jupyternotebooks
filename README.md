# Corona Jupyter Notebooks
Various visualizations of the corona pandemic based on data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)
This repo contains a jupyter notebook, in which the data of the CSSE are prepared in different visualizations. 
Under the following link a temporary notebook can be spawned. Here you can view the visualisations and implement anything you want to do with the data.
